                    It is an extracurricular activity in which students typically role play delegates to the United
                    Nations
                    and
                    simulate UN councils. The delegates represent different countries and attempt to solve real world
                    issues
                    using the policies and perspectives of their assigned country. At the end of the year, we hold a
                    conference
                    to allow our delegates the chance and experience to implement what they've learned throughout the
                    year.

                    prepare for MUN conferences, represent countries other than their own, and present possible

                    global problems in councils.
